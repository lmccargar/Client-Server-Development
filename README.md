**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

In the start we worked on CRUD module that create and read from a MongoDB no SQL database. This was helpful to understand the CRUD method while using Python language. Commenting in the code made the code readable, when adding dashboard widgets made the module adaptable, and the combination made the module maintainable. I could see using these methods learned in this in real life development efforts. 

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

I approach a computer problem starting from the error the systems throwing. Meaning, an error from code usually has exception handling. This help to determine the issue in most cases. From there I would look at the system as a whole, what are the expected processes and results. This course allowed us to develop the front-end, middle tier, and the backend data source, a true full stack system. Whereas, other courses I have not had the opportunity to biuld the whole system, but only parts of the systems. What was learned during this course adds to my knowledge to build such a system. In the future, I will have the knowledge to competently build such a system of business or an organization.   

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

My understanding of the work computer scientist do is to automate processes. Our jobs are to make complex processes work effectively. Removing mistakes caused by human errors.
